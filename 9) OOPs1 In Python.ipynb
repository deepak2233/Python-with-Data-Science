    "Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.\n",

    "- <b>Class</b> − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "- <b>Class variable</b> − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Data member</b> − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Function overloading</b> − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Instance variable</b> − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Inheritance</b> − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Instance</b> − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Instantiation</b> − The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Method</b> − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Object</b> − A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
